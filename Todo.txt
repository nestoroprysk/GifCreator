Gui-related:
21. Make order of buttons more logical
23. enable user to choose json only

Ideas:
11. use matrix of transformation
13. qt app for creation with real time vision ===ACCEPTED===
16. generalising primitives to something and
	enabling modifications on parts
	(e.g. a man of sticks must be able to move his hand,
	his hand's finger must be able to move and
	so on recursively)
17. it must be possible to create a bucket of objects
	to which to apply the behaviour (seems like a tag for a related
	group of objects is needed)
18. I want a neat way to create a static cloud of points
19. I want a neat way to create an inside-changing cloud of points
26. I must catch exceptions locally ===DENIED===
27. Unregister behaviour
28. Unregister object
29. Modifying behaviour via gif creator
30. registering an object with the same name should
	constitute overriding the previous
31. json error handling ===TENTATIVE===
